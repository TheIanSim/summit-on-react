Intepreting the assignment data per student chart:
>A student who appears on the top left corner of the screen is weaker, as this meant that he spent a lot of time on finishing the assignments, and he also did not complete much assignments. 

>Vice versa, a student who appears on the bottom right corner of the scren is a stronger student as he completes more assignments, and at a faster completion time.
