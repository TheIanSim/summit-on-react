![OverviewPage1](https://github.com/TheIanSim/summit-on-react/blob/master/readMePics/OverviewPage1.png?raw=true)

This is the overview screen. The inital data loaded is the students overall data. This screen loads the following data:

* Overall assignment data per student scatter diagram

![OverviewPage1Chart](https://github.com/TheIanSim/summit-on-react/blob/master/readMePics/OverviewPage1Chart.png?raw=true)

Intepreting the overall assignment data per student chart:
>A student who appears on the top left corner of the chart is weaker, as this meant that he spent a lot of time on finishing the assignments, and he also did not complete much assignments. 

>Vice versa, a student who appears on the bottom right corner of the chart is a stronger student as he completes more assignments, and at a faster completion time.


By scrolling down, you will now arrive at the assignment overview screen.

![OverviewPage2](https://github.com/TheIanSim/summit-on-react/blob/master/readMePics/OverviewPage2.png?raw=true)

* Overall student data per assignment scatter diagram

![OverviewPage2Chart](https://github.com/TheIanSim/summit-on-react/blob/master/readMePics/OverviewPage2Chart.png?raw=true)

Intepreting the overall student per assignment chart:
>An assignment that appears on the top left corner of the chart may be a more diffucult assignment, as it takes longer to complete on average, and that there is a lower completion rate as well, indicating that less students has completed it.

>Vice versa, an assignment that appears on the bottom right corner of the chart may be an easier assignment, as it takes shorter to complete on average, and that there is a higher completion rate as well, indicating that more students has completed it.

* Student completion rate pie chart
* Cross level comparison chart
* Overall statistics

Since the cross level comparison chart may be a bit dense due to so much information, we may hover our mouse to view the number of students who completed the codecombat level, as seen in the chart below.
